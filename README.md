# Portfolio

Employing a mobile-first approach and leveraging the power of React, I crafted a sleek and intuitive [portfolio web application](https://amikerb.github.io/Portfolio/) to impress prospective employers. My application boasts a seamless navigation bar, a captivating home page, an in-depth About Me section complete with a link to my CV, a comprehensive portfolio of my other websites, and a dedicated contact page for easy communication.
